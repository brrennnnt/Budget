                <h2>1. Prep</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 450 degrees. Bring large pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry produce.</li>
                    <li>Cut broccoli florets into 1 inch pieces if necessary. Zest and quarter lemon. Peel and mince or grate garlic.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>2. Roast Broccoli</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Toss broccoli on a baking sheet with a drizzle of olive oil, salt, and pepper.</li>
                    <li>Roast on top rack until browned and crispy, 12-15 minutes.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>3. Cook Pasta</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Once water is boiling, add spaghetti to pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 9-11 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Reserve half cup pasta cooking water, then drain.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>4. Make Garlic Butter</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>While pasta cooks, place 3 TBSP butter in a small microwave safe bowl. Microwave until just softened, 10 seconds. Add lemon zest, half the parmesan, a pinch of garlic, and a pinch of chili flakes if desired. Mash with a fork to combine. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>5. Cook Shrimp</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Rinse shrimp under cold water, then pat dry with paper towel. Toss in a large bowl with a large drizzle of olive oil, remaining garlic, salt, and pepper.</li>
                    <li>Heat a large pan over medium high heat. Add shrimp and cook, stirring occasionally, until opaque and cooked through, 2-4 minutes.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>6. Finish and Serve</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>To pan with shrimp, add drained spaghetti, broccoli, stock concentrate, garlic butter, and 1/4 cup reserved pasta cooking water. Toss until everything is thoroughly coated in sauce. Add a squeeze or two of lemon juice to taste. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
                    <li>Divide pasta between bowls and top with remaining parmesan and a pinch of chili flakes if desired. Serve with any remaining lemon wedges on the side.</li>
