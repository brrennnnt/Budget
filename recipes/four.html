                <h2>1. Prep</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Line a baking sheet with foil and brush with oil. Wash and dry produce.</li>
                    <li>Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion: mince a few slices until you have 1 tbsp.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>2. Make Filling</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add sliced onion: cook for 3 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add beef and Southwest Spice Blend: cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until beef is browned and onion is softened, 4-6 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Stir in Tex-Mex paste and 1/3 cup water. Simmer until mixture has thickened and beef is cooked through. 2-4 minutes more. Turn off heat.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>3. Assemble and Bake</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Meanwhile, drizzle tortillas with 1 tbsp olive oil: brush or rub to coat on both sides.</li>
                    <li>Place tortillas on a clean work surface. Once beef filling is done, add a heaping 1/4 cup filling to one side of each tortilla, then sprinkle each with 1 tbsp Mexican cheese blend. Roll up tortillas, starting with filled sides, to create flautas. Place, seam sides down, on prepared sheet.</li>
                    <li>Bake on middle rack until golden brown and crispy. 8-12 minutes.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>4. Finish and Serve</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>While flautas bake, finely dice tomato. Zest and quarter lime. In a small bowl, combine tomato, minced onion, half the lime zest, and a squeeze of lime juice. Season with salt.</li>
                    <li>In a separate bowl, combine sour cream, remaining lime zest, and a squeeze of lime juice. Add water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency. Season with salt.</li>
                    <li>Divide flautas between plates. Top with pico do gallo and lime crema. Serve.</li>
